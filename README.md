# MCKS (Minecraft Keybind Share)
> soon to be renamed

MCKS is a tool for laying out and sharing game control setups. Built in vue. Thanks to MCTiers, I yoinked your icons. Open a issue if you want me to stop. Feel free to open issues/PRs with added games. Please don't open PRs with new keyboard/mouse configs, open an issue if you desperately want one added.

Please don't read the code is so messy it's my first vue project.
